Authentication vs Authorization

a.Authentication: Verifies the identity of the user (e.g., using login credentials). It's like checking someone's ID to confirm they are who they say they are.
b.Authorization: Grants permission to the user to access specific resources or perform actions (e.g., deleting a user, accessing admin features). It ensures the user is allowed to carry out certain actions based on their role or permissions.

Why Only Authentication is Insufficient for Deleting Users
While the user might be authenticated (logged in), this doesn't necessarily mean they should be allowed to delete any user. For instance, a regular user should not have the ability to delete other users—this action should typically be restricted to admins or authorized personnel.

Without proper authorization, any authenticated user could potentially cause havoc by deleting other users. This is why both authentication and authorization should be combined to ensure security.

Diagram Representation
Here’s a basic flow of how both authentication and authorization work together:

+----------------+     +---------------------+     +-------------------+
|  User Requests |---->| Authentication Step |---->| Authorization Step |
|  (e.g., DELETE)|     |  (Verify Identity)  |     |  (Check Permissions)|
+----------------+     +---------------------+     +-------------------+
                                                             |
                                                             v
                                                +-------------------+
                                                |   Allow / Deny    |
                                                |   Action (Delete) |
                                                +-------------------+


Security Considerations: Authentication vs Authorization
Why Authentication Alone is Not Enough
In our application, we implement authentication to confirm the identity of a user. However, for actions like deleting a user, simply knowing the identity of the user is insufficient.

The Need for Authorization
Authorization ensures that users are allowed to perform specific actions based on their roles or permissions. This prevents unauthorized actions (like deleting users) from being performed by users who should not have such privileges.

Key Takeaway:
Authentication: Confirms who the user is.
Authorization: Confirms what the user is allowed to do.
Make sure that sensitive actions like deleting users are protected by both authentication and authorization to avoid unauthorized access.
